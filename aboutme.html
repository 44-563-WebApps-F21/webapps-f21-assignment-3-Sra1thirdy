<h4>My favourite superhero "Batman"</h4>
<p> 
    Batman is a fictional hero; he was created by the artist Bob Kane and the writer Bill Finger. 
    He made his first appearance in DC comics issue number 27 on May 1939. 
    Since his first showing he has been in many comics but mainly in one made by DC. Batman goes by many nicknames.
